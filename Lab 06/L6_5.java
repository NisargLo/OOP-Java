/*
    Create a class named ThreeDPoint to model a point in a three-dimensional space.
    Let ThreeDPoint be derived from MyPoint with following additional features:
    a. A data fields named z that represents the z-coordinate.
    b. A no-arg constructor that creates a point (0, 0, 0).
    c. A constructor that constructs a point with three specified coordinates.
    d. A get method that returns the z value.
    e. Override the distance method to return the distance between two points in the three-dimensional space.
    f. Write a program that creates two points (0, 0, 0) and (10, 30, 25.5) and display the distance between the two points.
