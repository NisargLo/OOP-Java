/*
    The Transport interface declares a deliver() method.
    The abstract class Animal is the super class of the Tiger, Camel, Deer and Donkey classes.
    The Transport interface is implemented by the Camel and Donkey classes. Write a test program that initialize an array of four Animal objects.
    If the object implements the Transport interface, the deliver() method is invoked.
